# Learning Module Specification: [MODULE NAME]

**Module Branch**: `[###-module-name]`  
**Created**: [DATE]  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: Instructor description: "$ARGUMENTS"

## Student Learning Journeys & Assessment *(mandatory)*

<!--
  IMPORTANT: Student journeys should be PRIORITIZED as learning paths ordered by importance.
  Each learning journey must be INDEPENDENTLY ASSESSABLE - meaning if you implement just ONE of them,
  you should still have a viable minimum learning module that delivers value.
  
  Assign priorities (P1, P2, P3, etc.) to each journey, where P1 is the most critical.
  Think of each journey as a standalone slice of learning that can be:
  - Taught independently
  - Assessed independently
  - Delivered independently
  - Demonstrated to students independently
-->

### Learning Journey 1 - [Brief Title] (Priority: P1)

[Describe this learning journey in plain language - what students will learn and why]

**Why this priority**: [Explain the learning value and why it has this priority level]

**Independent Assessment**: [Describe how this can be assessed independently - e.g., "Can be fully assessed by [specific exercise/project] and delivers [specific skill/knowledge]"]

**Assessment Scenarios**:

1. **Given** [student knowledge state], **When** [learning activity], **Then** [expected outcome/skill demonstrated]
2. **Given** [student knowledge state], **When** [learning activity], **Then** [expected outcome/skill demonstrated]

---

### Learning Journey 2 - [Brief Title] (Priority: P2)

[Describe this learning journey in plain language]

**Why this priority**: [Explain the learning value and why it has this priority level]

**Independent Assessment**: [Describe how this can be assessed independently]

**Assessment Scenarios**:

1. **Given** [student knowledge state], **When** [learning activity], **Then** [expected outcome/skill demonstrated]

---

### Learning Journey 3 - [Brief Title] (Priority: P3)

[Describe this learning journey in plain language]

**Why this priority**: [Explain the learning value and why it has this priority level]

**Independent Assessment**: [Describe how this can be assessed independently]

**Assessment Scenarios**:

1. **Given** [student knowledge state], **When** [learning activity], **Then** [expected outcome/skill demonstrated]

---

[Add more learning journeys as needed, each with an assigned priority]

### Edge Cases

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: The content in this section represents placeholders.
  Fill them out with the right edge cases for learning.
-->

- What happens when [diverse learner needs]?
- How does module handle [prerequisite knowledge gaps]?

## Learning Objectives *(mandatory)*

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: The content in this section represents placeholders.
  Fill them out with the right learning objectives.
-->

### Learning Outcomes

- **LO-001**: Students MUST be able to [specific skill/knowledge, e.g., "create interactive web pages with JavaScript"]
- **LO-002**: Students MUST be able to [specific skill/knowledge, e.g., "manipulate the DOM using vanilla JavaScript"]  
- **LO-003**: Students MUST be able to [key competency, e.g., "handle asynchronous operations with promises"]
- **LO-004**: Students MUST understand [concept, e.g., "event-driven programming principles"]
- **LO-005**: Students MUST demonstrate [skill, e.g., "debugging JavaScript code using browser dev tools"]

*Example of marking unclear objectives:*

- **LO-006**: Students MUST learn [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: proficiency level not specified - basic understanding, intermediate application, or advanced mastery?]
- **LO-007**: Students MUST complete [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: number of practice exercises not specified]

### Key Concepts *(include if module involves specific topics)*

- **[Concept 1]**: [What it represents, key aspects without implementation details]
- **[Concept 2]**: [What it represents, relationships to other concepts]

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Define measurable success criteria.
  These must be learner-focused and measurable.
-->

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: [Measurable metric, e.g., "Students can complete a basic interactive web app in under 60 minutes"]
- **SC-002**: [Measurable metric, e.g., "90% of students successfully complete the module assessment on first attempt"]
- **SC-003**: [Student satisfaction metric, e.g., "85% of students report feeling confident applying concepts on their own"]
- **SC-004**: [Learning metric, e.g., "Students demonstrate understanding through peer code review participation"]
