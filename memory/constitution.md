# [COURSE_NAME] Constitution
<!-- Example: JavaScript Web Development Course Constitution, React Fundamentals Course Constitution, etc. -->

## Core Principles

### [PRINCIPLE_1_NAME]
<!-- Example: I. Hands-On Learning First -->
[PRINCIPLE_1_DESCRIPTION]
<!-- Example: Every concept starts with a hands-on coding exercise; Exercises must be self-contained, independently testable, with clear instructions; Clear learning objective required - no exercises just for practice sake -->

### [PRINCIPLE_2_NAME]
<!-- Example: II. Real-World Projects -->
[PRINCIPLE_2_DESCRIPTION]
<!-- Example: Every module builds toward a real-world project; Projects should solve actual problems students care about; Support both guided and independent project work -->

### [PRINCIPLE_3_NAME]
<!-- Example: III. Assessment-First (NON-NEGOTIABLE) -->
[PRINCIPLE_3_DESCRIPTION]
<!-- Example: Assessment-driven design mandatory: Learning objectives defined → Assessment created → Learning activities designed; Backward design strictly enforced -->

### [PRINCIPLE_4_NAME]
<!-- Example: IV. Accessibility Standards -->
[PRINCIPLE_4_DESCRIPTION]
<!-- Example: All content must meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards; Code examples must be screen-reader friendly; Provide multiple learning modalities (text, video, interactive) -->

### [PRINCIPLE_5_NAME]
<!-- Example: V. Student Engagement, VI. Progressive Complexity, VII. Practical Application -->
[PRINCIPLE_5_DESCRIPTION]
<!-- Example: Interactive elements required for engagement; Scaffolded learning approach; Or: Build complexity gradually; Or: Start simple, avoid overwhelming beginners -->

## [SECTION_2_NAME]
<!-- Example: Additional Constraints, Technology Requirements, Assessment Policies, etc. -->

[SECTION_2_CONTENT]
<!-- Example: JavaScript-focused tech stack, browser-based development, specific LMS requirements, etc. -->

## [SECTION_3_NAME]
<!-- Example: Instructional Workflow, Peer Review Process, Quality Gates, etc. -->

[SECTION_3_CONTENT]
<!-- Example: Peer review requirements, student feedback collection, content approval process, etc. -->

## Governance
<!-- Example: Constitution supersedes all other instructional practices; Amendments require documentation, approval, migration plan -->

[GOVERNANCE_RULES]
<!-- Example: All content/reviews must verify compliance; Complexity must be justified; Use [GUIDANCE_FILE] for ongoing course development guidance -->
